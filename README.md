Enhancing Emergency Response Vehicle Interaction in Autonomous Driving Systems
The primary objective of this project was to investigate the capabilities of an autonomous vehicle in detecting and safely responding to emergency vehicles using a combination of visual and onboard sensor data. The emergency vehicles considered in this study encompassed police, fire, hospital, and other emergency responders' vehicles. To achieve this objective, the autonomous vehicle needed to possess real-time and accurate environmental perception capabilities, enabling it to appropriately yield to emergency vehicles.

The project leveraged machine learning algorithms to discern the presence of emergency vehicles primarily through the analysis of visual data from onboard cameras. Several image processing frameworks were assessed to identify the optimal combination of vision-based detection algorithms. Additionally, a novel lateral control algorithm was devised, specifically tailored for guiding the autonomous vehicle in executing maneuvers to bring it to a stop on the curbside when an emergency vehicle is detected in its path.

By integrating these advanced technical approaches, the project aimed to enhance the safety and responsiveness of autonomous vehicles in emergency situations, fostering a future where autonomous vehicles can seamlessly coexist with emergency responders and prioritize public safety.
